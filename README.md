# Pre-work - *Tippo*

**Tippo** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Justin Lee**

Time spent: **6-7** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.


The following **additional** features are implemented:
- Added the feature, where the user can rate how well the server performed in a number of categories. This
  rating system will help indecisive users decide on a more objective tip to give.

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- Make it so that the back button does not appear once you get to the options menu or initial screen ever.
- Add default tip values
- Allow the user to chose what qualities they value most in a server
- Have more animations, ui to fit my app's theme.

## Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

The user can chose the tip percentages and see what their total bill will turn out to be. The settings screen allows the user to have a default tip saved and ready.

more objective idea of how much they should tip.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The biggest difficulty was just getting adjusted to another programming language and using the tools of the language. Xcode was sort of confusing and took me some time to get used to. Also, making the app somewhat interesting was also hard because a tipCalculator is sort of useless in this day and age when bills at restaurants usually gives you tips by default. However, this made it more interesting in a way because I had to think more creatively to build the app. There weren't many ways I thought I could improve the intuitiveness of just a tip calculator other than to make the decision making of how much tip to give easier. I had to think more about the psychology of someone who is "cheap", and that's what I used to derive some of the functionalities of this app. This app will hopefully allow the decision making for someone who is indecisive about giving money to the waiter easier.
